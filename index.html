      Lots of things happened in 2020, and two of the most 
      influential matters are COVID and US Election 2020.
      Two major political parties in USA are Democrats and Republicans and each of them
      has its own view on mask wearing. Although it is known that mask wearing can efficiently
      decrease the chance of getting COVID, some politicians / individuals with certain
      policital standing are still unwilling to wear masks.

    <p>1. All of the graphs in are scatterplots. The red dots stand for Republican states 
      and blue dots stand for democratic states.</p>
    <p>2. The axis in each chart has a pretty good indication of the 
      data dots, so the tooltip only provides the name of the State. (Providing all 
      information within a small box would be visually uncomfortable and redundant)
